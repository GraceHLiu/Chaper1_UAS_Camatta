# Chaper1_UAS_Camatta

This project is the first research chapter of my dissertation proposal. 

In this project, I studied the connection between ground grass biophysical measurements and sUAS remote sensing vegetation indices and topographic properties, investigated the impact of soil moisture and soil temperature on forage production, and built centimeter-resolution models for forage production mapping using data collected from a delayed grazing private rangeland in Central Valley, California.
